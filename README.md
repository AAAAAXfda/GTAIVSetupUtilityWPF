# Gillian's GTA IV Setup Utility
Semi-automatically installs DXVK and launch options for your GTA IV installation. It automatically checks your hardware and what options should be available (aswell as setting defaults).

This version is a re-write of the now-deprecated [Python version](https://github.com/SandeMC/GTAIVSetupUtility).

## Contribution

Contribution is highly welcome. I'm poorly experienced with C#, but this rewrite was needed for many reasons. And so, the current code is extremely clunky and works out of prayers.
